# Library Catalog

This program was initially created to be used for the AP Computer Science Principles Create Task

# Purpose of the Program
The intention is that the user can input a query (book, movie, etc.), and a list of libraries with said query is returned
For example, if the query is the novel "All the Light We Cannot See" by Anthony Doerr, a list would be returned with which libraries have the book and its availability in each location.
The main library being used is the Library of Congress as it is the largest in the United States and has an API but more libraries will be added in the future.
Create an easy-to-use resource (and API in the future) to easily search for online resources rapidly

# Important Things That Need to be Read
